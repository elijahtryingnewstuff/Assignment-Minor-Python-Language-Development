Build Instructions

1. Prerequisites
-Have the latest version of Python installed (3.13+)
-Have a development environment like Visual Studio code.

2. Building setup
-Download the zip file and extract the individuals files on your machine.
-Open the files/folder using the development environment
-Make sure that the files are connected to the environment by running them individually and making sure there are no errors.

3. Running the code
-To run the interpreter in interactive mode/file reading, execute the following command in the terminal, or by pressing the run button on the "main.py" file.

-To run the interpreter, so it reads a source file, make sure that the source file is in the same folder that the development environment uses.
Visual example: https://prnt.sc/Jgyqy5SNSqQh, https://prnt.sc/mLoSrEomWMBk
The commands used in the terminal are "python main.py' <source file name>"

4. Testing
- The project includes five example source files (`example1.txt`, `example2.txt`, etc.) that demonstrate the features implemented up to Stage 2.
- Run these files using the command above to verify the functionality. 
"python main.py' <source file name>"

5. **Virtual Machine Setup**:
- Ensure Python (3.13+) is installed on your Azure Labs virtual machine.
- Follow the same steps as above to build and run the project.
